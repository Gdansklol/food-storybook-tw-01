# Getting Started with Create React App

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).

Creating an App
You’ll need to have Node >= 14 on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

npx
npx create-react-app my-app
(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

Scripts
Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

npm start or yarn start
npm
npm init react-app my-app
npm init <initializer> is available in npm 6+

# Storybook with Tailwind Css

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install Storybook

(https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-7-1/)

npx storybook@latest init

npx storybook@latest upgrade

In the project directory, you can run:

### `tailwindcss`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [Documentaion](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `tailwindcss`

npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [Documentation for getting start](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) for more information.

### `npm concurrently`

npm i concurrently

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
