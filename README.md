# Create React App

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).

Creating an App
You’ll need to have Node >= 14 on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

## npx

npx create-react-app my-app
(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

Scripts
Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

npm start or yarn start
npm
npm init react-app my-app
npm init <initializer> is available in npm 6+
